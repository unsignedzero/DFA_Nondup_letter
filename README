This is a DFA created in Haskell. The DFA will accept
all strings with the following property
  The starting end ending characters are the same.
  Any two neighboring letters are not the same.
The DFA accepts all strings that have a,b and c in their alphabeta.
(Only strings that contain a b or c.)

There is no main function so this must be loaded into GHC in order
to use this.

Created by David Tran using GHC v 7.4.1
